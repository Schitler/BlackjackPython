# BlackjackPython
 This is a simplyfied version of Blackjack to play in console. It's still not finished.
 Things I want to add(some of them maybe only dreams):
     -Menu
     -Tutorial
     -Option for player to change starter money
     -better UI
     -maybe a GUI(for that I would need help because I got no Idea)
     -multiple players, online(For that I would also need MUCH help)
     -let player chose amount of decks
     
     
The Raise option is only for development and will be deleted soon.
